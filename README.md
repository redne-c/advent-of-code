# Advent of Code

The beginning of my participation in Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Years of AOC

I found Advent of Code in the advent season of 2024.
I have since decided to refactor the code from that year and work backwards through other years.
At the time I was picking up the Go langugae, and each previous year I visit, I want to pick up a new language and learn some of its quirks.

+ 2015 - [Zig Programming Language](https://ziglang.org/)
